# Frequently Asked Questions


## What is Moeda?

Moeda is the first company of its kind within its field. It was
launched in 2017 during a UN’s hackathon and it sought to address UN’s 17
Sustainable Development Goals. Moeda’s business model is based on a
holistic approach for fostering sustainable development growth, and is made
up of three primary components: a proprietary digital token (MDA), a
peer-to-peer transfer application, and driving local businesses.


## What is Moeda’s mission?

To promote the economic well-being of excluded communities in a
sustainable way, making the investment process easier by eliminating the
common financial obstacles that small businesses face.


## What is Moeda’s story?

Moeda sprouted from an idea that blockchain technology offers
more trust, efficiency, transparency and access to financing for those who
don't currently have the means to acquire it. The company came to fruition
after the idea won the United Nations (UN) SDG hackathon and successfully
carried out a crowdfunding campaign in 2017. As of early 2018, Moeda has
funded 18 projects by local entrepreneurs and cooperatives in rural areas
within Brazil. The team is now hard at work on a mobile application, which
will boost investments in current and future projects and serve as a
banking tool for business owners who are impacted by Moeda.


## Where is Moeda based?

Moeda is a global company with headquarters in New York City in
the U.S. and in the Brazilian capital of Brasilia.


## How does Moeda refine the traditional investment impact of the micro-loan model?

Moeda provides unprecedented transparency for both the
beneficiaries and investors of micro-financing. Investors can track the
flow of capital along with the progress of all funded projects. Moeda's
platform also allows all female entrepreneurs to have their own digital
identity, enabling them - often for the first time –access and the means to
make viable financial records and acquire the credit needed to drive their
business and support their community.

The company also offers each of its female entrepreneurs local access to
financial education, suppliers, contacts and the market itself. Through a
combination of local capacity building and technological innovation, we are
building a new sustainable ecosystem for investments that have an impact.

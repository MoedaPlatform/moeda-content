# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is Moeda?

Moeda was launched in 2017 at a United Nations “hackathon” in order to address the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals. We selected the Seed Projects and facilitate access to financing for entrepreneurs with impact projects who have traditionally found it difficult to access credit through the traditional banking system. They can thus grow and allow their communities to develop. Through blockchain technology and our proprietary digital tokens (MDA, MDABRL), people around the world can promptly and transparently invest in the projects, all the while participating in sustainable growth. Everyone wins.

## What is Moeda's mission?

Moeda's mission is to promote a fairer and more impactful economy by connecting investors directly to entrepreneurs and promoting the UN Sustainable Development Goals. On one hand, we eliminate bureaucratic obstacles and facilitate financing using more realistic rates with better conditions for entrepreneurs who have limited access to traditional banking services. The projects we selected, known as Seed Projects, also receive support in technical areas, business and sustainability through the Moeda Seed Program. On the other hand, we have adopted the transparency of blockchain for investors from around the world to invest directly in Seed Projects with the flexibility of digital tokens, all within a new relationship of trust where people invest in people.

## What is Moeda's story?

Check out the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kk_Y_Ra3p9o) in which Moeda's CEO talks about our history and what motivates us.

Moeda was inspired by the idea that blockchain technology offers more confidence, efficiency, transparency and access to financing for those who have no means of obtaining it through the traditional system. The company emerged from the United Nations SDG Hackathon and conducted a successful crowdfunding campaign in 2017. In early 2018, Moeda began to select and support 18 projects involving family farming cooperatives in Brazil. Through this pilot, we understand our work, we have established processes and we synthesize learning, in addition to closing deals with key partnerships that will be applied when we open our investment portfolio to hundreds of Seed Projects in 2019. Upcoming steps include the launch of our Currency Seeds App, which will facilitate investing, keep track of the Seed Projects and will be used as a tool for the entrepreneurs we support. Starting in 2019, Moeda will begin an expansion to other Latin American countries.

## Where is Moeda?

Moeda is a global company with headquarters in Brasilia, Brazil's capital, and Montevideo, Uruguay.

## How does Moeda improve the traditional model of impact investments using micro-lending?

Moeda offers unprecedented transparency for both investors and those who benefit from micro-lending. Investors can track the flow of capital and the progress of all projects financed on our website, and shortly through the Moeda Seeds App. The Moeda platform also allows all entrepreneurs to have their own digital identity, enabling them, often for the first time, to have access to means of achieving viable financial records and to acquire the credit needed to boost their business and support their community. The use of blockchain technology ensures transparency throughout all our processes. In addition, the proprietary digital tokens (MDA, MDABRL) allow investors around the world to support our Seed Projects with flexibility. We’ve placed the Sustainable Development Goals in all Seed Projects and are working on new ways to measure each of their achievements and report their progress to the public. Through the combination of local capacity building and technological innovation, we are building a new sustainable ecosystem for impact investments.

## What has Moeda done since its launch?

Since its launch in April 2017, pilot projects have been organized and launched that will form the basis for our expansion, along with the preparation for releasing the Moeda Seeds App. As of December 2018, new investments will arrive on the site and the app, while hundreds of new Seed Projects are being prepared for investing.

## What are the obstacles that Moeda overcomes for its entrepreneurs?

We eliminate common obstacles that often don't make it feasible for ventures to take risks: extremely high rates, unfriendly terms and payment conditions, bureaucracy, brokers. We also facilitate access to technical support, business, the market and sustainability to ensure the success of Seed Project and to help the local community's autonomy. The Moeda Seeds App will also facilitate payments and loans among peer and empower underbanked entrepreneurs with impact projects that comply with the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

## What does underbanked mean?

"Underbanked" or "unbanked" is a term used to refer to the 38% of the world's population that has little or no access to traditional regulated banking services and financial credit. According to the latest World Bank estimates, there are about 2 billion unbanked people throughout the world. They suffer from a lack of access to credit or business loans, severely limiting their opportunities for economic growth. Pressured by unpredictable interest rates, predatory lending and an inability to establish credit, local underbanked entrepreneurs are often not able to access the capital needed to expand their business and establish meaningful financial security.

## What’s the purpose of Moeda's mobile app?

The Moeda Seeds App will allow investors and entrepreneurs to conduct their operations:

- instant end-to-end payments and more accessibility using digital tokens, avoiding limits and government fees on all transactions that take place within Moeda’s payment ecosystem
- offer a transparent record of financial activities that reflects all transactions made through the application on blockchain
- share knowledge, new impact models and mutual support, supplying tools for exploring the details of the Seed Project
- create a system where users are classified by merit for credit in addition to becoming the owners of their own financial data, using a digital identity linked to an immutable ledger in blockchain.

On top of that, it will also be used as a source of information for our perfect systems team, developing new products and services and helping to better understand how Moeda can aid everyone involved.

## Is Moeda just an App?

Moeda is more than a currency or an application: it's a platform that uses technology to link investors with impact entrepreneurs in a transparent, fair and flexible manner. The Moeda Seeds App is just one of the tools for an entire ecosystem based on identity, two structures of digital token (MDA and MDABRL) and keeping track of project accountability. The architecture of our systems possesses a hybrid format that combines different technologies. The Moeda Seed Program is capable of lending support to technical assistants so they can analyse, evaluate risks, select projects and following up on investments and results. The results of each step are stored in our audited blockchain, which connects with the MDABRL smart contract token to keep track of all spending in the ecosystem. All results create attributes in the user’s Blockchain ID. You can only access investments if you have an MDA token.

## Why does Moeda use blockchain technology?

Blockchain technology facilitates the exchange of values without the need for intermediaries or brokers, allowing the parties to interact transparently through a reliable and secure network that delivers certified and auditable data access, streamlining existing processes, reducing costs, and increasing capital efficiency. Unlike traditional means of banking and currency exchange, blockchain technology is specially suited for impact investments. More specifically, using blockchain technology, the Moeda platform provides:

- transparency for currency transactions and investment progress
- sovereign digital identity for users of the platform
- quicker transfer of loan funds and increased accessibility through the use of digital tokens
- lower rates than those typically associated with payments and remittances through traditional channels of financial institutions.

## How many tokens have been created and how many are in circulation?

20 million tokens (MDAs) were created,and 19,628,888 are in circulation.

## Where can I purchase MDA?

MDAs are a crucial part of you being able to participate in the investments from our platform. They are no longer being created at this point, and you will need to purchase them from an existing holder. To do this, contact an exchange (cryptocurrency exchange) to check on the values, conditions, regulatory requirements and make a trade. The following exchanges deal in our token: [Binance](https://www.binance.com/), [LBank](https://www.lbank.info/), [BKex](https://www.bkex.com/), [EtherDelta](https://etherdelta.com/), [Allcoin](https://www.allcoin.com/), [Coinbene](https://www.coinbene.com/).

## What's the difference between Moeda and other cryptocurrencies?

Moeda's focus isn’t only on cryptocurrencies. We recognize its innovative aspect in our business model as a tool that offers flexibility and facilitates an investment, but our focus is on the blockchain. This technology has a plethora of uses to boost investment in impact entrepreneurs, especially those who are underbanked. We provide services, in certain respects, that are similar to those of a social investment platform. We're contributing an asset for the purpose of financing impact entrepreneurs. As such, Moeda is no longer a digital currency — it only uses this feature to streamline and facilitate the investment of people around the world in our Seed Projects.

## Why does Moeda focus on humanitarian causes? Doesn’t this affect investments?

In the new reality of the global economy, we acknowledge that sustainability is not only a humanitarian cause, but also a factor that should be part of a company’s business plans, no matter their size or where they’re from. To support the UN Sustainable Development Goals and contribute to a more balanced reality has also proven important for investments in long-term thinking. Supporting impact projects that are already arising with the UN SDGs in their DNA is a major advantage, given that these are projects that will not be at a loss to meet this new imperative - an imperative that is already expanding the thinking surrounding business sustainability and investing in more advanced technologies. What’s more, countless studies have shown that it promotes a social and solidarity economy that bolsters local prosperity and improves purchase conditions for everyone. Investing in sustainability is an advantage in this nascent market.

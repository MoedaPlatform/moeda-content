# Frequently Asked Questions


## What is Moeda?

Moeda is the first company of its kind within its field. It was
launched in 2017 during a UN’s hackathon and it sought to address UN’s 17
Sustainable Development Goals. Moeda’s business model is based on a
holistic approach for fostering sustainable development growth, and is made
up of three primary components: a proprietary digital token (MDA), a
peer-to-peer transfer application, and driving local businesses.


## What is Moeda’s mission?

To promote the economic well-being of excluded communities in a
sustainable way, making the investment process easier by eliminating the
common financial obstacles that small businesses face.


## What is Moeda’s story?

Moeda sprouted from an idea that blockchain technology offers
more trust, efficiency, transparency and access to financing for those who
don't currently have the means to acquire it. The company came to fruition
after the idea won the United Nations (UN) SDG hackathon and successfully
carried out a crowdfunding campaign in 2017. As of early 2018, Moeda has
funded 18 projects by local entrepreneurs and cooperatives in rural areas
within Brazil. The team is now hard at work on a mobile application, which
will boost investments in current and future projects and serve as a
banking tool for business owners who are impacted by Moeda.


## Where is Moeda based?

Moeda is a global company with headquarters in New York City in
the U.S. and in the Brazilian capital of Brasilia.


## How does Moeda refine the traditional investment impact of the micro-loan model?

Moeda provides unprecedented transparency for both the
beneficiaries and investors of micro-financing. Investors can track the
flow of capital along with the progress of all funded projects. Moeda's
platform also allows all female entrepreneurs to have their own digital
identity, enabling them - often for the first time –access and the means to
make viable financial records and acquire the credit needed to drive their
business and support their community.

The company also offers each of its female entrepreneurs local access to
financial education, suppliers, contacts and the market itself. Through a
combination of local capacity building and technological innovation, we are
building a new sustainable ecosystem for investments that have an impact.


## What's Moeda been doing since its launch?

Moeda has been quite busy since it kicked off in April 2017. Some of the
team's major milestones so far have been:
- **August 2017**: Moeda conducted an ICO where US$ 20 million in cryptography (BTC/ETH) was raised. A total of 20,000,000 MDA tokens were issued.
- **September 2017**: Moeda issues tokens for investors and agents.
- **January 2017**: Moeda announces funding for its first round of Seed Projects in rural Brazil.


## What’s Moeda working on now?

First of all: the Moeda Seeds app!

The first Seed Projects from Moeda were all officially financed. We'll keep
everyone updated on their progress as our local staff guides them on
scaling their projects. Through this initial effort, Moeda plans to invest
US$ 10 million in more than 100,000 loans to vetted entrepreneurs in 2019.

## What are some of the obstacles that Moeda removes for small businesses?

Excessive fees, no access to financial credit and high interest
rates are some of the hurdles that the Moeda platform endeavors to reduce.
The Moeda Seeds application will facilitate payments and lending among
peers and was specifically designed to empower underbanked entrepreneurs
with little or no direct relationships with banks and whose businesses
comply with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.


## What does underbanked mean?

Underbanked, or sometimes used interchangeably as unbanked, is a
term used in reference to the 38% of the world population that has little
or no access to regulated banking services and financial credit. Recent
estimates by the World Bank's indicate that there are around 2 billion
underbanked people throughout the globe.

Underbanked populations suffer from a lack of credit or access to
commercial loans. This lack of financial representation places severe
limits on their possibilities for economic growth. Burdened by
unpredictable interest rates, predatory lending, and an inability to
establish credit, local underbanked entrepreneurs often find themselves
unable to access the capital needed to expand their business and establish
significant financial security.


## What is the purpose of Moeda Seeds app?

Moeda's first application is intended to be a tool for those
investing in the Seeds Projects and for financing entrepreneurs, along with
providing the Moeda team with valuable feedback to develop and improve
future endeavors.

Specifically, Moeda Seeds will:
- Allow users to create credit worthiness (often for the first time) and take charge of their own financial data using a digital identity tied to an immutable blockchain ledger.
- Allow for instant and easier peer-to-peer payments using digital tokens, avoiding limits and fees from the government on all transactions that take place within the Moeda's payment ecosystem.
- Provide a transparent record of financial activity by mirroring all transactions made through the application in the blockchain.
- Encourage knowledge sharing, new impact models and mutual support by providing tools that explore the details of seed projects financed by Moeda.


## Is Moeda just an app?

Moeda is a lot more than just a currency or an app: It's a whole
ecosystem based on identity, two different token structures (MDA and
MDA-BRL), and tracking project accountability. Our systems' architecture
contains a hybrid format that combines a variety of technologies. The TA
(Technical Assistance) system is able to support technical assistants in
their efforts to analyze, evaluate risks, select projects and track
investments and their outcomes. Results from each step are stored in our
audited blockchain, which connects to the MDA-BRL smart contract token to
track all spending in the ecosystem. These results create attributes in
the user's Blockchain ID. Access to investments can only be done if you
have the MDA token. To better understand the entire structure of our
architecture, [click here.](/whitepaper)


## Why does Moeda use blockchain technology?

Blockchain technology facilitates the exchange of funds without
requiring an intermediary. It also allows for transparent interactions
between parties through a reliable and secure network that distributes
certified and auditable access to data, thus simplifying existing
processes, reducing costs and increasing capital efficiency.

Unlike traditional means of banking and exchange, blockchain technology is
especially suited for impact investments. Specifically, through the use of
blockchain technology, the Moeda platform provides:
- Transparent currency transactions and the progress of investments
- A sovereign digital identity for users of the platform
- Quicker transfer of loan proceeds and greater accessibility through the use of digital tokens
- Lower rates than those typically associated with payments and transfers done through traditional financial institutions


## How many tokens were created? And how many are now in circulation?

**20,000,000** tokens were created.<br>
**19,628,888** tokens are currently in circulation.


## Where can I purchase MDA?

As of now, MDA is no longer being created. MDA can be bought
from an existing holder. Moeda does not support or facilitate any MDA
trading or listing MDA on any cryptocurrency exchanges.

Participation in activities involving social impact investments on Moeda's
platform requires MDA. Those wishing to acquire MDA to participate in the
platform should contact a crypto-currency exchange to find out if it can be
bought at that exchange and determine the regulatory requirements to
participate.


## Can I invest in Moeda projects without MDA by just using my money in Dollars ($)?

To access Moeda's ecosystem (investments, payments, products)
from outside of Brazil, MDA is required. Without MDA, you can only register
for a Moeda account if you are a Brazilian holding a valid Brazilian
Taxpayer Identification Number.


## What's the difference between Moeda and other cryptocurrencies?

Although one of the innovative aspects of Moeda's business model
is its cryptocurrency, Moeda is decisively different from most of its peers
in this market. It focuses on the catalyst of digital currency - the
blockchain - and on this technology's plethora of uses to propel
investments for underbanked entrepreneurs.

In certain respects, we provide similar services to those of a social
investment platform - contributing an asset for the purpose of financing
entrepreneurs with considerable and sustainable potential. Appropriate
structuring, advisors located near entrepreneurs, and the launch of
the Moeda Seeds application will result in a significant upward
appreciation as the value proposition is made available to even more people.

But to remain true to our vision, Moeda's growth plan is necessarily
adaptable in order to provide the time, qualitative learning and
flexibility necessary for growth centered on people and maximizing the
value of investors and those entrepreneurs aided through our financing.


## Why does Moeda aid humanitarian causes? Doesn't this affect investments?

Moeda is more than a currency, it's an ecosystem. The fact that
we have proved the use of our technology both in the financial and
humanitarian areas is a great opportunity for success. We're not just an
application, we're in the process of building a complex system and using
blockchain in different ways: identity, two structures of the token
(MDA and MDA-BRL) and tracking project accountability.


## How can I find out more about Moeda's technical elements?

Moeda has a detailed report that will be available soon.
